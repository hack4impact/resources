# Contributing

If you have any ideas/updates/things you find useful, please
[fork](https://github.com/hack4impact/resources), commit your
changes, and open up a PR (you'll need to select "compare across forks").

If you don't know how to use Git but still want to contribute, the Pencil Edit
icon allows you to edit a file and submit a PR all through the web interface.
Alternatively, open up an issue, or send me an email via
[admin@hack4impact.org](admin@hack4impact.org).

## Style Guide

We like keeping lines at 80 characters max. The frequent exception will be lines
that have to contain long URL's.

Note that each bullet-pointed link has two trailing spaces, to induce a line
break in Markdown.

For new files, let's use kebab-case (lowercase each word, separate words with
hyphens). Example: `new-file.md`

Please no tab characters; they sometimes format as Code Blocks. Please use 2
space characters.

## On Commit Messages

Please write descriptive commit messages. A message that says "Added
_some topic_ to _some file_" is far more useful to the maintainers and other
contributors than leaving the default "Update some-file-name" message.

## Code of Conduct

We use and enforce the
[Contributor Covenant, v1.4](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/). To
report violations, email [admin@hack4impact.org](admin@hack4impact.org), the
maintainer.
